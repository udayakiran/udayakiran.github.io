## Why ?

- Underscore js is nothing but a simple js library that gives a number of js functional programming helpers which can be used in your js code. It works well with your own js libraries like prototypejs, jQuery or backbone.
- More importantly, it does not modify any built-in objects to add these methods. In the practicle scenario, we use multiple libraries from different authors. It is important that built-in objects are not extended in any of this code to avoid side effects. (An example problem caused by extending Array.prototype add adding methods/properties - <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8859828/javascript-what-dangers-are-in-extending-array-prototype>)
- Easy to get started and makes you productive in minutes.

## Open issue / Caution -

> I would say "There are out of count ways to create classes in JS but ring.js is one cool way if you want to write classical style of OO code and take the advantage of multiple inheritance."
