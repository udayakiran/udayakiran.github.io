Having built multiple engineerings sites ground up till 50+ engineers in the past, I always consider hiring as one of the important processes to constantly learn, unlearn and evolve in the current competitive talent landscape. Many great leaders who could scale engineering orgs have peculiar and effective hiring methodologies. Hiring right talent fast has been single most successful factor in accelerating many leaders' career path and ensuring they can deliver.

## Challenges

Some of the challenges I faced and I frequently heard from my leaders during hiring process.

- Team is not established yet. There is no ongoing project or a service. Alexa is vast, but interesting (!) Where do i stop? Engineers prefer learning by doing. Access to Expert engineers & Time zone issues. New tech stack/tooling specific expertise (Swift? Android? Horizonte?) Obsoleteness of the documentation. How long is the ramp up time? Understanding the quality bar. Building the right team culture!

## What worked for me

Below are some of the things that worked for me where I was able to setup multiple engineering teams. The situations include - 

- [x] Setting up a ~ 30 member team from scratch in < 5 months.
- [x] Growing a 60 member team to ~ 100 in < 6 months.
- [x] Helping my over all org to move from 30 to 150 in < 1 year.

### 1. Set the Expectations Right Away for Onboarding Plan

I have always owned the hiring process and outcomes myself and advice leaders to do the same. Recuitment team is a stakeholder and helps in your team setup. Avoid delegating hiring process to recruitment team and play the role of enabler. Have a high bar in each step that you are responsible for such as - 

- Explain the hiring needs clearly, providing forecasting for head count. 
- Always prioritze your positions. Not everything is a high priority.
- Provide clear job descriptions, examples and be part of sourcing.
- Scout for internal referenes. Reward the referrals.
- Exploratory discussions with candidates.
- Arragne interview panels as required.
- Be responsive. You are likely to receive larger feed of prospects to screen and decide on. Candidates pick your team if you are faster.
- Help other leaders in hiring by providing interview bandwidth. 

### 2. Your First Meeting

Generally recruitment teams are handling multiple roles and are always packed. They co-own the goal of hiring for multiple leaders. Engineering leads who partner and collaborate well with recruitment teams yield better success. A few tips - 

- Give ideas and quality feedback to your recruitment team.
- Feed the team with enough details of your business/product so they can communicate better with candidates.
- Understand their working style and make yourself available. 
- Get to know your agencies beyond direct recruitment team. Help in sourcing by sharing internal refferals, your linked in contacts and etc.
-  Don't have metric driven relationship with recruiting. Socialize and learn the hiring trends across industry.
-  Know the talent landscape/Limitations. Be flexible to ideas from team.

### 3. Share the Personalised Plan

Generally engineering leaders are packed with tons of things on a daily basis. Hiring can;t be taken as a part time activity as it demands quality time and constant focus.

- Have a weekly/biweekly or even more frequent regular catchups with recruitment teams.
- Have time blocked in your calendar to speak with candidates for exploratory discussions and interviews.
- Have template to exchange visibility on hiring process with your recruitment team and engineering leadership.

### 4. Have a Buddy, A Mentor

Some leaders are worried about sustainability and quality when they hire fast. They are concious about 'hiring mistakes'. I disagree with that thought process. You always need to hire fast! Quality and sustainability comes together by holding high bar in candidate selection but not by being slow. Also, onboarding and initial engagement for candidates need to be taken into consideration when setting up teams especially new sites. 

- Tweak your entire process to be faster. Identify the bottlenecks and make them faster.
- Sourcing: Explore all options available for sourcing. Sourcing is the top of your hiring funnel. Have a strong sourcing process.
- Interviews: Ensure interview panels are available. Reward interviewers for time spent. Coach panels. Maintain good interview experience bar.
- Debrief/Decision Making: Have timeline for giving your decision once onsites are done.
- Offer rollout and roll sell calls: Have clear and faster offer rollout mechanism and roll sell process for hired candidates.

### 5. Setup Check Points

No matter what's the speed at which you want to hire, hold a high and right hiring bar. Remember that high bar does not mean too many rejections. It has to deal with ensuring correct job leveling guidelines, souring right, having right interview loop consturcuted, having a bar raising and culure fitment discussions, providing visibility of the bar to candidates so they are well prepared. It;s not possible to ensure a 100% fit and successful hiring process but always improve iteratively. Note that having a wrong hire and replacing them is very costly.

### 6. Focus on Internal Talent Hiring.

Internal transfers are common in any medium to large size companies. Try to tap onto prospective internal candidates through good visibility for your team. Ensure that you are not 'poaching' any one. Your team's reputation is key in attracting internal candidates who are looking for options. Internal hires are key when you are starting teams fresh as they bring in lots of tribal knowledge of the company and culture. They hit the road running fast. 

When you are looking at internal hires - 

- Follow internal procedures. Don't skip the loop.
- Share as much as open information about team with the prospects. Understand mutual fitment.
- Talk to current manager, review the feedback and allow a graceful transfer process.
- Be transparent about career aspirations and growth oppurtunites of internal candidates.

### 7. Travel, Conduct Hiring Events. Go Blitz hiring!

You should reach out to talent in groups then letting them reach out to you. I could always hire faster by travelling across the country and some times cross borders. For example , When we had to help my sisters teams grow from 30 to 150 based on Bangalore, we travelled to 5 cities conducting hiring events twice a month. 70% of our hiring was done through these events.

- Prepare strong interview panels and recruiters who like to travel.
- Plan the hiring events across cities. Give time to the team for preparations.
- Plan ahead for a sufficient candidate foot fall on day of hiring. Let candidates go through pre- screening to ensure quality.
- Organize the event day well. Plan to roll out offers on the same day possibly or ASAP.

### 8. Post Offer Engagement.

### 9. Learn. Share the Feedback with Relevant Stakeholders.
