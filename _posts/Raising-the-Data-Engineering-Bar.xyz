Data Engineering Excellence is a trade-off across use case, cost (storage + maintenance) and capabilities of infrastructure.

Conclusions / Recommendations

\1. Spam Analyst does good job at providing small number of high quality decisions.

Need to take steps to improve the data ingestion, access and querying abilities of

this system.

\2. In an ideal state Decision logic should have been just run on Operational data

storage and be surfaced on reporting tool choice (Ex- Run your decision bot on

vogon/redshift, Surface the conclusions on Tableau interface or MBR emailers)

\3. Spam Analyst have taken up the closed decision engine approach, Vogon has

taken up data infrastructure approach. We need a middle path with Spam analyst

team continuing to focus on their decisions while making it easier to ingest and

access data.

\4. Continue to have the dev teams own the transactional data through managed

services and make them accountable to send each data point to their own

operational stores or Spam Analyst. Product dashboards continue to be served out

of their own stores.

\5. Make entire data multi tenant to avoid compliance issues between competitors and

provide access. Support internal and external standard views explicitly.

\6. High quality, confidential decision reports are to be access controlled.

\7. Spam Analyst has the potential to become single source of truth by supporting data

connectors, multitenancy, tableau integration and real time programmatic APIs.





Data Bar Raising Program

\- All new feature Launches of BT2 will go through data bar raising program to address pain points

mentioned earlier. This is also followed to migrate the earlier data sources on demand.

\- Program recommends and mandates below.

A. There is a central Data TPM (DTPM) who is responsible to validate if products meet data bar

when being launched.

C. Data bar - Product owners of each product work with Data TPM to define what data needs to

be stored and tracked across sources A,B,C.

D. DTPM Validates if data is complete, adheres to storage, compliance and retention policies.

Depending on local body ruleset more are added (GDPR, COPPA and etc.)

E. Each product's Product Manager owns the data and EM is responsible for ensuring data is

stored, audited and reported correctly.

F. Product with violation of data policies will not be allowed to launch without an SVP approval.

They will be given a fast follow time of 30 days (max 60 days) to fix this.

G. DTPM works with various infra teams and tools to ensure product and engineering teams have

right tooling in place.

H. DTPM also initiates data migration projects and runs it with infra and product teams.





Data Bar & Check list

\1. Is data completely stored from all sources, for all events defined by business?

\2. Are there monitors inplace to alert when data does not populate/incorrectly populates?

\3. Data classification policy (RED, YELLOW, GREEN)

\4. Is data retention and deletion process defined? Is this validated with compliance teams?

\5. What is the fast follow data flow?

\6. Known data risks? ETA to fix them?

\7. Who are the users with access to this data?

\8. Data Access review - External Vs internal users.

\9. Business dashboards and emailers for review.

\10. Next audit suggestions.





Features required

Spam Analyst:

\1. Multi tenancy

\2. External data access.

\3. Data access control and roles

\4. Support data ingestion from known storage infra out of box (Redshift, SQL, Kafka, Vogon,

Google cloud storage)

\5. View level access control

\6. Mobile SDKs for events.

\7. Custom Querying interface

\8. Monitors and alter groups

\9. To p level and aggregated views for business leaders.

Vogon:

TBD

Cost - Contd..

**Vogon:** vogon cost varies a lot depending on workload but typical cost comes out to be this

$6/month (1 cpu, 3GB mem, 1TB space)

**Konom:**

Varies a lot and in the end it is assigned based on actual usages.
